* should gues language but also be configurable

### Screen Lock

* like strava, have the timer (and scores?) in a notification thing. 
* have the Game On screen running full screen like strava live run

### New Game

* App should remember the referee/owner's name

### Timer

* game stop/starts are timestamped
* points are timestamped in game
* provide full breakdown in Game Over screen

### Cards

### UI

### Game Over

### Laws of the Game
